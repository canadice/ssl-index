# The Simulation Soccer League Index

<!-- Welcome to the index for the [Simulation Soccer League](http://sslforums.com/) -->

The Simulation Soccer League (SSL) is a simulated league of soccer
combining the Be-A-Pro game mode with Football Manager. Every player in
the league has been created by a real user in the world and the entire
organization is run by volunteers.

## About the Index

The SSL Index holds a lot of different functions not found on the [SSL
Forums](https://forum.simulationsoccer.com). You can find the schedule,
standings, player statistics (per game, per season, or career) as well
as some tools for visualizing the players and data gathered from
Football Manager.
