# The Simulation Soccer League Index

<!-- Welcome to the index for the [Simulation Soccer League](http://sslforums.com/) -->

The Simulation Soccer League (SSL) is a simulated league of soccer
combining the Be-A-Pro game mode with Football Manager. Every player in
the league has been created by a real user in the world and the entire
organization is run by volunteers.

## About the Index

The SSL Index holds a lot of different functions not found on the (SSL

standings, player statistics (per game, per season, or career) as well
as some tools for visualizing the players and data gathered from
Football Manager.
