# The Simulation Soccer League Index

<!-- Welcome to the index for the [Simulation Soccer League](http://sslforums.com/) -->

 The Simulation Soccer League (SSL) is a simulated league of soccer combining the Be-A-Pro game mode with Football Manager. Every player in the league has been created by a real user in the world and the entire organization is run by volunteers.

## About the Index
The SSL Index holds a lot of different functions not found on the (SSL Forums)[https://simsoccer.jcink.net]. You can find the schedule, standings, player statistics (per game, per season, or career) as well as some tools for visualizing the players and data gathered from Football Manager.
